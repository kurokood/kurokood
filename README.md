Kumusta, I'm Mon 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a cloud enthusiast with a deep passion for architecting secure, scalable cloud-native solutions — but this journey didn’t start in the cloud.

Long before I entered the cloud space, I was a self-employed full-stack administrator managing a video-on-demand (VOD) streaming website. I built, maintained, and scaled the platform independently — handling everything from Linux server administration, front-end and back-end development, to payment integration and user experience. That project taught me the real-world challenges of building something from scratch, and more importantly, how to make it profitable.

Through strategic monetization efforts like advertising, premium memberships, and backend automation, I turned the VOD platform into a sustainable source of income. That experience sparked my love for systems, automation, and technical problem-solving. Still, I knew there was more to learn — and that led me down the path of upskilling.

Initially, I set my sights on a cybersecurity career. I dove into structured learning and earned certifications like:

- 📜 **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**
- 🔐 **CompTIA Security+**

These credentials gave me solid foundations in securing systems, threat analysis, and network defense. But as I deepened my studies, I discovered something that excited me even more: **the cloud**.

It wasn't just the buzz around cloud computing — it was the endless possibilities to **build, automate, and innovate at scale** that pulled me in. I found joy in provisioning infrastructure using code, connecting services, and designing systems that could serve real users globally.

I pivoted my focus and committed fully to learning cloud engineering and DevOps. Along the way, I earned several industry-recognized certifications:

- ☁️ **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**
- 🛠️ **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate**
- 🧪 **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate**
- 🐍 **Python Programming for AWS**

These credentials are more than badges — they represent hours of hands-on labs, real-world projects, and deep dives into topics like IAM, VPC, EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform.

Today, I’m building cloud-native end-to-end projects, serverless applications deployed on AWS using Terraform. I focus on infrastructure architecture, automation, scalability, and security.

I’m constantly experimenting with AWS services, writing IaC templates, designing network architectures, and developing full-stack cloud applications.

Cloud computing excites me because it’s where creativity meets engineering. I love turning an idea into a working, scalable architecture — from routing DNS traffic with Route 53, to securing resources with IAM, and delivering content globally through CloudFront.
