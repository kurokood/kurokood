Long before I entered the cloud space, I was a self-employed full-stack administrator managing a video-on-demand (VOD) streaming website. I built, maintained, and scaled the platform independently â€” handling everything from Linux server administration, front-end and back-end development, to payment integration and user experience. That project taught me the real-world challenges of building something from scratch, and more importantly, how to make it profitable.
